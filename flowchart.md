### Explanation of Components:

*   **User**: The end-user interacting with the application.
*   **Main Application UI**: The central graphical user interface that orchestrates all other components. This includes the main window and overall application logic.
*   **AI Agent & Tools**: The core AI functionality, including the AI agent itself and the tools it can utilize (e.g., for code generation, analysis, or task execution).
*   **IDE Features (Editor, Terminal, File Explorer)**: The integrated development environment components, such as the code editor, interactive terminal, command output viewer, and file explorer.
*   **Network Manager**: Handles all network communication, including interactions with external APIs or remote services.
*   **Worker Threads**: Manages background tasks and long-running operations to keep the UI responsive.
*   **Configuration**: Provides application settings and themes, influencing the behavior and appearance of the Main Application UI.

### Flow Description:

1.  The **User** interacts directly with the **Main Application UI**.
2.  The **Main Application UI** serves as the central hub, coordinating interactions with:
    *   **AI Agent & Tools**: The UI sends requests to the AI agent and receives responses, which may involve the AI agent using various tools.
    *   **IDE Features**: The UI manages the display and interaction with the code editor, terminal, and file explorer.
    *   **Network Manager**: The UI initiates network requests (e.g., for updates, external data) through the Network Manager.
    *   **Worker Threads**: The UI offloads heavy computations or long-running tasks to worker threads to maintain responsiveness.
3.  **AI Agent & Tools** can make **External API Calls** via the **Network Manager**.
4.  **IDE Features** can perform **File Operations / Remote Access** also via the **Network Manager**.
5.  **Configuration** influences the **Main Application UI** by providing settings and theme information.
